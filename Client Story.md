Client_Background
Client Overview

Client Name: PayNexa Technologies Ltd.
Industry: FinTech – Digital Payments & SME Finance
Stage: Startup (Pre–Series A)
Geography: Bangladesh (planned SEA expansion)

PayNexa started as a lightweight QR-based payment solution for SMEs. Within 9 months, transaction volume grew rapidly, onboarding hundreds of merchants. However, internal systems were built quickly with short-term thinking and lacked structure, governance, and compliance readiness.

Business Environment

Increasing regulatory scrutiny (KYC, AML)

Investor pressure for accurate metrics

High operational dependency on manual processes

Limited runway (cash burn sensitivity)


📄 Founder_Narrative

“Initially, speed mattered more than structure.
Now, we are stuck with multiple tools, spreadsheets, and partial systems.

Every board meeting requires manual reporting.
Our engineers are constantly fixing production issues.

Investors want numbers we can’t confidently provide.
Regulators want audit trails we don’t have.

We don’t need fancy features.
We need control, visibility, and reliability — without burning cash.”

This narrative was delivered over multiple conversations, often changing focus, reflecting typical startup ambiguity.
